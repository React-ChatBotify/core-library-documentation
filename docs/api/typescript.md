# Typescript

The library provides the following external type definitions which you may import:
- [**Block**](/concepts/conversations#block)
- [**Flow**](/concepts/conversations#flow)
- [**Message**](/concepts/conversations#message)
- [**Params**](/concepts/conversations#params)
- [**Plugins**](/concepts/plugins)
- [**Settings**](/concepts/settings)
- [**Styles**](/concepts/styles)
- [**Toasts**](/concepts/conversations#toast)
- [**Themes**](/concepts/themes)

:::tip Tip

Use an editor that is able to automatically detect the required types for an easier time! You may also refer to the type definitions [**here**](https://github.com/react-chatbotify/react-chatbotify/tree/main/src/types).

Now that you have a broad idea of how the library works, let us take a look at some [**examples**](/examples/basic_form) in the next section!
