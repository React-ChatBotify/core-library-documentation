# Typescript

The library provides the following external type definitions which you may import:
- [**Block**](/docs/concepts/conversations#block)
- [**Flow**](/docs/concepts/conversations#flow)
- [**Message**](/docs/concepts/conversations#message)
- [**Params**](/docs/concepts/conversations#params)
- [**Plugins**](/docs/concepts/plugins)
- [**Settings**](/docs/concepts/settings)
- [**Styles**](/docs/concepts/styles)
- [**Toasts**](/docs/concepts/conversations#toast)
- [**Themes**](/docs/concepts/themes)

:::tip Tip

Use an editor that is able to automatically detect the required types for an easier time! You may also refer to the type definitions [**here**](https://github.com/react-chatbotify/react-chatbotify/tree/main/src/types).
