# Typescript

The library provides the following type definitions (click to find out more!):
- [**Block**](/docs/introduction/conversations#block)
- [**Flow**](/docs/introduction/conversations#flow)
- [**Message**](/docs/introduction/conversations#message)
- [**Options**](/docs/introduction/bot_options)
- [**Params**](/docs/introduction/conversations#params)

:::tip Tip

Use an editor that is able to automatically detect the required types for an easier time! You may also refer to the type definitions [**here**](https://github.com/tjtanjin/react-chatbotify/tree/main/src/types).

Now that you have a broad idea of how the library works, you are strongly encouraged to refer to the [**API documentation**](/docs/api/bot_options) for specific information regarding each of the sections/properties. We will explore this in the next section!
